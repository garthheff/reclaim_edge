A guide for taking back control of Microsoft Edge New Tab, startup, home, and address bar behavior.

With Firefox taking a new direction (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tHOhMjB498) I jumped ship to Edge and quickly found that Bing search is heavily enforced on the New Tab page. After some searching, I found there are only a few realistic solutions for regaining control of the New Tab experience:

* Host a local intranet site and use the official Edge policy

* Use an existing New Tab extension. Most of the ones tested attempted to stand out by beign more than just a redirect.

* Build a lightweight redirect extension focused purely on New Tab behavior.
